Southwell's introduction to Saint Peter's Complaint 


Transcribed from facsimiles in the Early English Books Online (EEBO) database. Numerous 
sources state that the 1616 version of the Complaint is the first to include the 
initials: W. S. (See Short Title Catalogue [STC] (2nd ed.) / 22964 from 1620 for an example of the 
wording.) The present list is ordered by printed or inferred date. -- bkm


Methodology

The original notes were taken from images on EEBO which uses catalogue numbers from the second 
edition of the STC.  Usually the epistle to the "cousin" was printed on a single leaf (a recto
and a verso). The next recto usually contained "The author to the reader." The camera framing for 
the facsimiles oftens shows the verso of the "cousin" epistle. It is reasonable to presume where 
the "cousin" verso exists that the "cousin" recto exists on the other side of the leaf but has 
not been photographed. Another posibility is that the verso has been photographed but has been 
omitted from the online database.  

In some cases, the verso before the "author" epistle is seen to be blank. Without having the 
actual document to hand, it is unclear if in these cases that there is no "cousin" epistle or if 
it exists but is separated from the "author" epistle by a blank leaf.

As the STC is also online (as the English Short Title Catalogue [ESTC]), in addition to my 
original EEBO notes I have added fields from the ESTS where the STC (2nd ed.) catalogue number 
from EEBO matches the "Citation/references" field in ESTC.

Sources for this transcript are roughly:

  EEBO: publication date 
  ETSC: ESTC Citation No. field
  EEBO: STC (2nd ed.) catalogue number
  ETSC: General Note field (optional)
  EEBO: location of filmed original
  ETSC: Publisher/year field
  bkm:  transcript of epistle title
  bkm:  notes (optional)

ESTC has an "Electronic location" field which often links to the EEBO entry, but I have 
not included this field in the present document.
